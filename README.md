# MyCalculator
My first PyCharm project, mainly I'm implementing first year tasks just to practice Python and PyCharm.

The Project is not over!,
I have a list of functions and options to add to this project ,
I'm a computer science student in my second year so for now I do not find the time to finish the project, but it will be done.
